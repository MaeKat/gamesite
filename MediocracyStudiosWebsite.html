                <p>
                    Full Moon is a 2D game about a boy named Alfie who tries to save his village from a curse that's
                    turning them all into wolves. The curse did not fully work on Alfie and he is stuck in a half wolf,
                    half human form. If Alfie doesn't get rid of the curse in
                    time, then his village will all become wolves forever; permanently losing their humanity and
                    intelligence. The curse takes time to set in, however, and so you'll have to help Alfie find the
                    evil wizard that is responsible for the curse
                    before he loses everyone he loves, and possibly himself.
